# Introduction
This is a pure systemverilog/verilog Testbench for risc-v SoCs. Those SoCs can be be generated by chipyard(https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard). 

By default, the DUTs(risc-v cores) in chipyard simulation is tethered, which means the DUT(cores) can not be boot from memory automaticly.

And in this testbench , we build a testbench for  standalone DUT which means the core can bringup itself (has its own bootrom, loads programs itself, etc).

# How to run
## Prerequirements
    Make sure you have RISC-V gcc toolchain installed. 
    Make sure the simulation tools is installed.

## 1. generate hex file for bootrom
```makefile   
    cd ./bootrom; 
    make hex;
```    
    you can see a .hex  file is generated in this folder.
## 2. generate hex file for SRAM
```makefile   
    cd ./case; 
    make all;
``` 
    you can see a .hex  file is generated in this folder.
## 3. run RTL simulation
```makefile   
    cd ./vsim; 
    make run;
``` 
    you can see the the string "Hello RISC-V!" is printed on the terminal. And a .fsdb waveform is emmited in the folder.
Tips: for more commands just refer to the Makefiles.


# Directory Introduction

## bootrom
    bootrom assemble program. which will be loaded in the maskrom(Address:0x10000)
## case  
    CPU initial programs and user programs.
    Most of the code is porting from sifive freedom platform. 
## src  
    RISC-V SoC RTL files. Those files is generated by chipyard from chisel. 
## svtb  
    SystemVerilog testbench files.
## vsim
    Scripts for VCS Simulation.
